The solution involves a multi-pronged approach:

1. **Update Expo CLI:**  Open your terminal and run `npm install -g expo-cli` (or `yarn global add expo-cli`) to upgrade to the latest version.
2. **Update Expo Go:**  Update the Expo Go app on your device or simulator through your app store.
3. **Check Project Configuration:** Carefully review your `app.json` for any errors in your configurations, such as missing or incorrect keys. Also check `package.json` for missing or outdated dependencies.
4. **Check Node.js and npm/yarn:** Ensure that Node.js is up-to-date; you might need to reinstall it. Also update your npm/yarn versions (`npm install -g npm@latest` or `npm install -g yarn`).
5. **Clean and Rebuild:** Try running `expo prebuild` and then `expo start` to clear the cache and build the project from scratch.  If the issue persists, delete the `node_modules` folder and reinstall dependencies using `npm install` or `yarn install`.
6. **Create a New Project:** In cases where the problem is particularly difficult to trace, creating a new Expo project can help to determine if the issue is within the project's files and configuration or related to the broader development environment.
