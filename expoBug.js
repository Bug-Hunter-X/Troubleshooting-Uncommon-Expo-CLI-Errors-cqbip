This error typically occurs when you have a mismatch between the versions of Expo CLI and the Expo Go app on your device or simulator.  The CLI might be trying to use features or functionalities not supported by the older Expo Go version.  Another potential cause is an issue with the project's configuration files (such as `app.json` or `package.json`), where incorrect settings may lead to unexpected behavior during the build process.  Finally, it could also stem from problems related to the underlying Node.js installation, particularly if it's outdated or corrupted.
