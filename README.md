# Troubleshooting Uncommon Expo CLI Errors

This repository demonstrates solutions for uncommon errors encountered when using the Expo CLI.  These errors often stem from version mismatches, configuration issues, or problems with the Node.js environment.

## Common Scenarios and Solutions:

* **Version Mismatch:** Ensure your Expo CLI and Expo Go app versions are compatible. Update both to their latest versions.
* **Configuration Issues:** Double-check your `app.json` and `package.json` files for any typos, incorrect settings, or missing dependencies.
* **Node.js Problems:** Verify that Node.js is properly installed and updated. Consider reinstalling it if necessary.  Also check your npm or yarn package manager versions.
